	Diffrence between int and Integer


     * Integer is object type and int is primitive datatype
	 * Integer are allocated from the heap and  int are often allocated from the stack
	 * Integer is mutable datatype but int is immutable  
	 * Object are passed by reference but int are passed by value.
		For Example :
					Integer i = new Integer(25);
					String s = i.toString();
					
					It stores 25 as string

					int i = 25;
					String s = i.toString();
					
					We cant convert because it gives compilation error..
